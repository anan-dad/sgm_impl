# SGM_impl

This is an implementation of Semi Global Matching (SGM) using the message passing algrithm which corresponds to my solution of a lab course GPU programming in university of Freiburg.

## Key idea

- Inward pass (by dynamic programming)
- Outward pass (again by dynamic programming)
- Combination of messages
